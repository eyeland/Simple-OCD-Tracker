### OCD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, is a mental health condition characterized by recurring, unwanted thoughts (obsessions) and/or repetitive behaviors or mental acts (compulsions). People with OCD often feel compelled to perform certain actions or rituals in order to reduce anxiety caused by their obsessions.

## Here are five common things that people with OCD may check:

1. Doors and windows: People with OCD may check multiple times to make sure that all doors and windows in their home are locked, for fear of burglars or other intruders.
2. Appliances and electronics: OCD sufferers may check that appliances like ovens, stoves, and irons are turned off, or that electronics like computers and televisions are unplugged to prevent a fire.
3. Health-related items: People with OCD may check their pulse, blood pressure, or body temperature multiple times a day, or repeatedly check for symptoms of a particular illness.
4. Cleanliness and order: People with OCD may check for cleanliness and order in their home, such as making sure that everything is in its proper place or that floors are clean.
5. Safety of loved ones: Some people with OCD may check multiple times a day on the safety of their loved ones, such as calling or texting them to ensure they are safe or driving by their house.

## It's important to note that everyone's experience with OCD is different, and these are just a few examples of common compulsions.
## It's important to seek professional help if you believe you or someone you know may be suffering from OCD.
